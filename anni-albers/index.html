<h1>Designing as Visual Organization</h1>
<h2>Excerpts from Chapter 10 of the book On Weaving, by Anni Albers, 1965</h2>

<p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth. What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity. Here we have, then, natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And here before us we can recognize the essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified organization of forms that is distinct from nature’s secretive and complex working.</p>

<p>Or on a beach, we may find a button, a bottle, a plank of wood, immediately recognizable as “our” doing, belonging to our world of forms and not to that which made the shells, the seaweed, and the undulated tracings of waves on sand. Also we can observe the counterplay of the forming forces: the sea slowly grinding an evenly walled piece of glass, foreign to it in shape and substance, into a multiform body suitable for adoption into its own orbit of figuration. On the other hand, we see the waves controlled, where dams and dikes draw a rigid line between land and water.</p>

<p class="callout">“…when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our characteristics:
forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.”</p>

<p>To turn from “looking at” to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature’s fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about. We may argue that sometimes we follow her method and plant a bush here and another there, but even then we “clear” the ground. Always, though sometimes in a way that is roundabout and apparent only as an underlying scheme of composition, it is clarity that we seek. But when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.</p>

<p>If, then, it appears that our stamp is or should be an immediate or implicit lucidity, a considered position, a reduction to the comprehensible by reason or intuition in whatever we touch (confusion always gets a negative rating), we have established a basis for designing — designing in any field. From city-planning to the planning of a house or road, from the composing of music to the formulation of a law, the weaving of a fabric, or the painting of a picture — behind the endless list of things shaped is a work of clarification, of controlled formulation.</p>
